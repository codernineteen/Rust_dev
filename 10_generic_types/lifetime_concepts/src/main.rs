//Lifetime Annotations in Function Signatures
//lifetime of parameters and lifetime of returned references are same -> returned reference will be valid as long as both params are.
//The lifetime annotations become part of the contract of the function
//the generic lifetime 'a will get the concrete lifetime that is equal to the smaller of the lifetimes of x and y.
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }

//#4
//lifetime annotations in Struct definition
struct ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
    part: &'a str, // this annotation means that an instance of this struct can't outlive the reference it holds in its field.
}

//#5 - lifetime elision rules.
//Lifetimes on function or method parameters are called input lifetimes,
//and lifetimes on return values are called output lifetimes.
//Three rules to figure out what lifetimes references have when there arenâ€™t explicit annotations.

//1.each parameter that is a reference gets its own lifetime parameter .
//e.g ) fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32); / fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32); / and so on.
//2. if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters
//e.g ) fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32.
//3. if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is &self or &mut self because this is a method,
//the lifetime of self is assigned to all output lifetime parameters.

//Let's apply this rule with example
//fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
// apply first rule ->
//fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &str {
// apply second rule ->
//fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str {
// after applying rule -> we can see all the parameters have lifetime and also returned reference has lifetime -> no need to apply lifetime on ourselves

//Another example
//fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {
//first rule ->
//fn longest<'a,'b>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str) -> &str {
//second, third rule can't be applied -> return doesn't have lifetime
//In this case, we should specify lifetime on ourselves.

//#6
//All string literals have the 'static lifetime -> can lice for the entire duration of program
